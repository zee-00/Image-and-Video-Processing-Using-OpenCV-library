**Image and Video Processing**
Image and video processing techniques using the OpenCV library in Python. OpenCV is a powerful open-source computer vision and image processing 
library widely used in various applications, including robotics, surveillance, and augmented reality.

**Features**
1) Image Processing: Various image processing techniques such as resizing, grayscale conversion, edge detection, and cropping are demonstrated.
2) Video Processing: Processing of video streams, including reading, displaying, and writing videos, as well as basic operations like record your webcam, etc.

**Face Detection with OpenCV**
This project demonstrates face detection using the OpenCV library in Python. OpenCV is a powerful open-source computer vision and image processing library widely used in various applications, including face detection, object tracking, and augmented reality.

**Features**
1) Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in images and video streams.
2) Real-time Detection: Demonstrates real-time face detection from live video input or webcam feed.
